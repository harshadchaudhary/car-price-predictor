"# car-price-predictor" 

"Developed an end-to-end machine learning application to predict car prices based on key attributes such as brand, year, fuel type, mileage, and transmission. * Model Building & Evaluation: Implemented and compared multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree) using Python and Scikit-learn; evaluated performance using R² Score and Mean Absolute Error metrics. * Data Processing & Feature Engineering: Performed extensive data cleaning, outlier removal, and feature scaling using Pandas and NumPy for improved model accuracy. * Deployment & Frontend Integration: Built a Flask-based backend API and integrated it with an HTML/CSS frontend interface to allow users to input car details and view predicted prices in real time.")
